# End-to-end deep learning pipeline for on-board extraterrestrial rock segmentation

Code for the paper "Towards on-board extraterrestrial rock segmentation using deep learning" by Daniel Marek and Jakub Nalepa.

The Training-Pipeline file containes all the code for training and evaluating models on the Aritifical Lunar Landscape Dataset.

The Mars-Data-Exploration file contains the code for processing and running the previously prepared models.
